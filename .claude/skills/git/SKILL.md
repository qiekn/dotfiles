# Conventional Commits

```
type(scope): summary
```

| type     | 用途                 |
| -------- | ----------           |
| feat     | 新功能（用户能感知） |
| fix      | bug                  |
| refactor | 重构（不改变行为）   |
| perf     | 性能优化             |
| chore    | 杂项                 |
| docs     | 文档                 |
| style    | 格式                 |
| test     | 测试                 |

# Core Principle

> A commit represents a **logical change (intent)**, not a sequence of actions.

# When generating a commit message

## 1. Determine the intent

Classify the change:

* Is it user-visible? → `feat`
* Is it fixing incorrect behavior? → `fix`
* Is it restructuring code? → `refactor`
* Is it improving performance? → `perf`
* Is it just setup / assets / config? → `chore`


## 2. Infer the scope

Use the most relevant module:

Examples:

* texture
* bvh
* camera
* render
* scene
* material

---

## 3. Write the summary

Rules:

* Use imperative mood
* Be concise but specific
* Avoid vague verbs like "update", "change", "fix stuff"

Good:

```
feat(texture): add Perlin noise with turbulence
perf(bvh): optimize traversal performance
refactor(camera): simplify ray generation logic
```

Bad:

```
feat: update texture
feat: improve things
feat: fix bug
```

---

# Rewrite Rules (VERY IMPORTANT)

## Rule 1: Collapse noisy commits

If multiple commits represent iterations of the same idea:

```
feat: tweak interpolation
feat: fix interpolation
feat: tweak again
```

→ Rewrite as:

```
perf(texture): improve interpolation stability
```

---

## Rule 2: Avoid misusing `feat`

DO NOT use `feat` for:

* algorithm tweaks
* internal improvements
* refactoring
* experiments

---

## Rule 3: Scene / demo changes

If change is not a core feature:

```
chore(scene): update Cornell box setup
```

---

## Rule 4: Prefer meaning over chronology

DO NOT describe process:

```
feat: try new method
feat: fix previous mistake
```

```
refactor(texture): replace interpolation method
```

---

# Granularity Rule

A good commit should:

* represent one idea
* be understandable in isolation
* be meaningful in project history

---

# Output Format

Return ONLY the commit message:

```
type(scope): summary
```

No explanation unless explicitly requested.

---

# Optional Extended Body (if needed)

```
type(scope): summary

- key change 1
- key change 2
- reason (optional)
```

---

# Goal

Make git history readable as a **high-level evolution of the system**, not a log of developer actions.
